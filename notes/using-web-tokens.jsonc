    //* Using Web Tokens - JSON
    /* It seems that you are referring to "Web Tokens" and their relationship with JSON. However, the terms
"Web Tokens" and "JSON" are not directly related to each other. Below I provide you with an explanation of
both concepts and how they can be used together: */
    // 1. **Web Tokens:**
    /* - A "Web Token" generally refers to a security or identity token used in applications
website to authenticate and authorize users. Web tokens can be JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or
simply text strings generated by the server. */
    /* - Web tokens are a common way to implement token-based authentication in web applications
and web services. Authenticated users receive a token after logging in, and this token is
used to access protected resources in the application. */
    // 2. **JSON - JavaScript Object Notation:**
    /* - JSON is a data exchange format used to represent structured information.
It is a human-readable text format that uses key-value pairs and nested object structures.
and arrangements for representing data. */
    /* - JSON is used in a wide variety of applications, including communication between the client and
the server, the exchange of data in web services, the storage of information in databases
NoSql and application configuration, among other uses. */
    /* The relationship between Web Tokens and JSON lies in how web tokens are transmitted and how the tokens are stored.
identity-related data in a structured format. Typically, web tokens, such as
Jwt, use a JSON format to include information about the user, permissions and other data
related to authentication and authorization. */
    // A Jwt, for example, consists of three parts encoded in JSON format:
    /* the header (header), the body (payload) and a digital signature. The body of the JWT is where the
information related to the user's identity and other relevant data in JSON format. This allows
applications to access and verify user information efficiently. */
    /* In summary, Web Tokens and JSON can be related when using JSON-based web tokens,
such as Jwt, to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and web services. JSON se
used to structure and represent data within web tokens, making it easier to access the
information related to the user's identity. */

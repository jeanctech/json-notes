    //* Validate Syntax - JSON
    /* Syntax validation in JSON is important to ensure that data structured in
JSON are correct and comply with the syntax rules. Below are some ways to
validate the syntax of a JSON document. */
    // 1. **Online tools:**
    /* - You can use free online tools, such as JSONLint, that allow you to paste or upload a
JSON fragment and check its syntax. These tools will point out syntax errors and
They will provide suggestions to correct them. */
    // 2. **Validation in the Programming Language:**
    /* - Most modern programming languages offer built-in libraries or functions to
validate JSON syntax. For example, in JavaScript, you can use the `JSON.parse()` function to parse
a JSON string and detect syntax errors. */
    // This technique is especially useful if you need to validate JSON in the context of your application.
    // 3. **Integrated Development Tools (Ide):**
    /* - Many modern Ides provide syntax highlighting and real-time validation for documents
JSON. This makes it easy to detect and correct syntax errors as you type. */
    // 4. **JSON Schemas (JSON Schema):**
    /* - JSON Schema is a specification that defines the structure and restrictions of a JSON document.
You can define a JSON schema that describes the valid structure of your JSON data and then use
JSON Schema validators to check if documents comply with that schema. */
    // 5. **Libraries and Validation Tools:**
    /* - In many programming languages, there are specific libraries and tools for validation
by JSON. For example, in Python, you can use the JSON Schema library to validate JSON against a
JSON Schema. */
    /* By using these tools and techniques, you can ensure that your JSON documents are
syntactically valid and comply with formatting rules. This is important to ensure a
effective communication between systems and applications that use JSON as a data format. */

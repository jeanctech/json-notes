   //* Storage and Retrieval of Data in JSON
   /* Storing and retrieving data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is one way
common to manage structured information in web applications and software in general. JSON is a format
lightweight, easy-to-read data exchange that uses a key-value pair structure. Here
You have a basic guide on how to perform data storage and retrieval in JSON. */
   // 1. **Structure of a JSON file**
   /* JSON is represented with objects and arrays. A JSON object is similar to a dictionary in Python or a
object in JavaScript. A JSON array is an ordered collection of values. */
   // Example of a JSON object
   // Structure of a JSON File
   "name": "John",
   "age": 30,
   "city": "Exampleville",
   // Example of a JSON Array
   "array": [
      "Apple",
      "Banana",
      "Orange"
   ],
   //Data Storage
   "name_one": "John",
   "age_one": 30,
   "city_one": "Exampleville"
   // 2. **JSON Data Storage**
   /* You can store JSON data in files or in databases. Here are some examples: */
   // - **Storing to a JSON file:** You can write JSON data to a file using
   // your preferred programming language. For example, in Python.
   /* - **Storage in a database:** If you are using a database, many databases
Modern data processors support JSON data storage directly. You can insert JSON objects in
the database and then retrieve them as needed. */
   // 3. **JSON data retrieval:**
   /* To retrieve data from a JSON file or database, simply read the data
and analyze them. Here is an example of how to retrieve data from a JSON file in Python. */
   // 4. **JSON data manipulation**
   /* You can add, modify and delete data in a JSON object before storing it or after
recover them. To do this, simply access the values using the keys and update the data
as necessary. */
   /* JSON is a versatile way to store structured data and is widely used in development
of web applications and data exchange systems. You can use specific libraries in your
Preferred programming language to work with J more efficiently and safely. */

    //* Arrays - JSON
    /* JSON - JavaScript Object Notation) is a data exchange format that does not support data structures.
multidimensional data like arrays directly. Instead of arrays, JSON uses objects and
arrangements to represent structured data. However, it is possible to emulate arrays using arrays
nested in JSON. Here is an explanation of how to do it. */
    /* In JSON, an object is represented by curly braces `{}` and contains key-value pairs. An arrangement is
represented enclosed in square brackets `[]` and contains an ordered list of values. To emulate an array,
you can use a JSON array where the elements of the array are stored as elements within that array. These
Elements can be other nested arrays to emulate a multidimensional array structure. */
    // For example, consider a two-dimensional array in JavaScript that represents a grid of numbers:
    // Array in JSON
    "array": [
        [
            1,
            2,
            3
        ],
        [
            4,
            5,
            6
        ],
        [
            7,
            8,
            9
        ]
    ],
    // Rows in Arrays in JSON
    "rows": [
        {
            "data": [
                1,
                2,
                3
            ]
        },
        {
            "data": [
                4,
                5,
                6
            ]
        },
        {
            "data": [
                7,
                8,
                9
            ]
        }
    ]
    /* Each row of the matrix is represented as an array nested within the main array. This
way, you can emulate a multidimensional array structure in JSON. */
    /* If you need to represent additional information or labels for rows or columns, you can use objects
JSON to achieve it. For example: */
    /* This example uses an object with a "rows" property that contains a list of objects, each
one of which has a "data" property that stores the row values as an array. */
    /* Remember that, in JSON, all property names and strings must be enclosed in double quotes, and
numbers, booleans, and null values should not be enclosed in quotes. */

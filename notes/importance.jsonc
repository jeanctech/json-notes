    //* Importance - JSON
    /* JSON - JavaScript Object Notation is a widely important data exchange format in the
world of computing and programming. Its importance lies in several reasons: */
    // 1. **Simplicity and Readability:**
    /* JSON is easy to understand and read by both humans and machines. Its key-value pair structure and
Lists of values make it easy to represent structured data in a clear and concise manner. */
    // 2. **Agnostic Language:**
    /* JSON is programming language independent, meaning it can be used in a
wide variety of platforms and systems. This makes it ideal for communication between applications
written in different languages. */
    // 3. **Wide Adoption:**
    /* JSON has been widely adopted in the software development community. Used in a variety
of applications, from data exchange in web services to data storage in databases
NoSql data and application configuration. */
    // 4. **Lightness:**
    /* JSON is a lightweight data format compared to other formats like Xml. This means that it has a
lower bandwidth consumption and is more efficient in transmitting data over networks, which is
especially important in web and mobile applications. */
    // 5. **Facilitates Interoperability:**
    /* JSON is essential for communication between client and server in web applications and web services.
Facilitates interoperability by providing a common format for exchanging data, allowing
different systems and applications understand each other. */
    // 6. **Simplicity in Development:**
    /* Working with JSON is easy. Most modern programming languages are supported
Built-in to parse and generate JSON. This simplifies the development of applications that require the
structured data exchange. */
    // 7. **Web Applications and APIs:**
    /* JSON is widely used in web application development and creating Api (interfaces
of application programming). API responses are usually in JSON format, allowing users to
Web applications consume and present data efficiently. */
    // 8. **Storage in NoSql Databases:**
    /* Many NoSql databases, such as MongoDb, CouchDb, and Firebase, store data in JSON format or in a
JSON extension (Bson). This allows efficient storage of structured data in these databases.
data. */
    // 9. **Universal Exchange Format:**
    /* JSON has become a universal data exchange format in many applications, from networks
social networks to the Internet of Things (IoT). */
    /* In summary, the importance of JSON lies in its simplicity, versatility and its fundamental role in the
data exchange in web applications, web services and a wide variety of systems and platforms. His
Easy understanding and use make it essential in modern software development. */

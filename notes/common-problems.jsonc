    //* Common Problems - JSON
    /* Despite the simplicity and wide adoption of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), there are some
common problems that developers may face when working with JSON. Here is a list of
common problems and how to address them. */
    // 1. **Incorrect Syntax:**
    /* One of the most common problems is incorrect syntax in a JSON document. This may be due to
missing or extra commas, curly braces that do not close correctly, unquoted text strings, or
typographical errors. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Use JSON validation tools, such as JSON Lint, to verify the syntax of your documents
JSON. Modern Ides also typically offer syntax highlighting and automatic error correction. */
    // 2. **Incorrect Coding:**
    /* Make sure the JSON document is encoded correctly. If encoding is used
incorrect, it can cause problems when interpreting the JSON. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Use UTF-8 encoding for your JSON documents, as it is widely supported and recommended. */
    // 3. **Misuse of Quotes:**
    /* Keys and text strings in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes. Use single quotes u
forgetting quotes can cause problems. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Make sure all keys and strings are enclosed in double quotes. */
    // 4. **Duplicate Keys:**
    /* JSON does not allow duplicate keys in the same object. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Make sure all keys in a JSON object are unique. */
    // 5. **Order of Elements:**
    /* JSON does not guarantee a specific order of key-value pairs in an object. Depending on the context, the
order of the elements may not be significant. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Don't trust the order of elements within a JSON object. If order is important, consider
use a JSON array instead. */
    // 6. **Incorrect Parsification:**
    /* When parsing (parsing) JSON in your code, it is important to handle parsification errors. A bad JSON
formed can cause exceptions in your application. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Use JSON parsing functions provided by your programming language and handle parsing errors
parsification correctly. */
    // 7. **Excessive Data Size:**
    /* In some circumstances, excessive use of JSON data may increase bandwidth consumption and
affect performance. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Consider JSON data compression if data transfer efficiency is critical. */
    // 8. **Excessive Nesting:**
    /* Excessive nesting of objects and arrays in JSON can make it difficult to read and maintain.
code. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Keep the structure of your JSON as simple and clear as possible. Avoid nesting objects deeply and
arrangements if not necessary. */
    // 9. **Security:**
    /* Security is important when receiving and parsing JSON data from external sources, as the content
Malicious can cause security problems, such as injection attacks. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Validates and sanitizes JSON data before processing. Use safe libraries to parse JSON and
prevents the execution of malicious code. */
    // 10. **Excessive File Size:**
    /* JSON is not the ideal choice for storing large data sets due to its human-readable text.
humans. In such cases, it is preferable to use more efficient formats such as Bson or binary protocols. */
    // Solution:**
    /* Evaluates whether JSON is the best option for storing large amounts of data. In some cases, it may be
necessary to use a more efficient data format. */
    /* In general, proper use of JSON and adherence to syntax and best practices will help avoid
most common problems associated with this data format. */

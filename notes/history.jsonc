    //* History - JSON
    /* The history of JSON - JavaScript Object Notation dates back to the 2000s and is closely
related to JavaScript development and the need for a lightweight, easy-to-use data format
to exchange information between web applications. Here is a summary of the history of JSON. */
    // 1. **Origins in JavaScript:**
    /* JSON is based on object notation in JavaScript. JavaScript, created by Brendan Eich in 1995, is a
programming language that is commonly used on the client side in web applications. The notation
of objects in JavaScript, which uses key-value pairs, served as the basis for JSON. */
    // 2. **Douglas Crockford and the formalization of JSON:**
    /* Douglas Crockford, a programmer and author, played a key role in the formalization and
JSON standardization. In 2001, Crockford proposed the JSON format as a lightweight alternative to XML.
(Extensible Markup Language) for data exchange between web applications. JSON is based on
JavaScript object notation but is separated from JavaScript functions, which makes it
independent of language. */
    // 3. **Specification and standardization:**
    /* The formal JSON specification was published in Rfc 4627 (Request for Comments) in 2006. This Rfc
It described the structure and format of JSON and provided guidelines for its use. Standardization
helped promote the adoption of JSON in a wide range of applications and web services. */
    // 4. **Widespread adoption:**
    /* JSON quickly became a popular data format due to its simplicity, readability, and
Easy to use. It was widely used in web applications and services, and its adoption accelerated with the
growing popularity of web APIs and the need to transmit data between client and application applications
servers. */
    // 5. **JSON in NoSql databases:**
    /* With the rise of NoSql databases in the 2010s, JSON became a data format
common for storing structured information. Databases like MongoDb use Bson (Binary JSON),
a JSON extension, to store data efficiently. */
    // 6. **Programming language support:**
    /* Most modern programming languages have built-in support for working with JSON,
which has facilitated its use in applications on a variety of platforms. */
    // 7. **Expansion to IoT and beyond:**
    /* JSON has become a common format for exchanging data in a wide variety of
applications, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time data processing. */
    /* In summary, JSON has seen massive adoption in the software development community due to
to its simplicity, readability, and ability to represent structured data efficiently. Ha
played a fundamental role in the evolution of the web and in the interoperability of applications and
services. */

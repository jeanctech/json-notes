   //* Consume and Produce Data - JSON
   /* Consuming and producing data in JSON format is a fundamental part of application development and
systems that interact with Apis, databases and web services. Next, I will show you how to consume
(retrieve) and produce (send) data in JSON format in the context of an application. */
   // Consume JSON Data (Data Retrieval):**
   /* 1. **Http Request:** To consume JSON data from an API or web service, you must perform a
Http request (for example, a Get request) to the API endpoint that provides the data in
JSON format. */
   /* 2. **Retrieve response:** Once the request is completed successfully, you will receive a response
Http that includes JSON data in the response body. You can use libraries in your language
programming (for example, `fetch` in JavaScript, `requests` in Python) to make the request and
retrieve the answer. */
   /* 3. **Parse JSON:** After retrieving the response, you must parse the JSON data using a
function provided by your language library (for example, `JSON.parse()` in JavaScript,
`JSON.loads()` in Python) to convert the JSON string into objects or data structures that you can
use in your application. */
   // JavaScript example using `fetch` to consume JSON data
   /*
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data-endpoint')
   .then(response => response.JSON())
   .then(data => {
     .// Data in JSON format is available in the "data" variable
     console.log(data);
   });
```
*/
   // Produce JSON Data (Send Data):**
   /* 1. **Create a data structure:** In your application, you must first create a data structure that
you want to send as JSON. This could be an object, an array, or another data structure depending on your
needs.

2. **Serialize to JSON:** Use a function provided by your language library (e.g.
`JSON.stringify()` in JavaScript, `JSON.dumps()` in Python) to convert the data structure into a
JSON string.

3. **Send the data:** To send the JSON data to an Api or web service, you must make a request
Http (for example, a Post or Put request) to the corresponding endpoint. You must include the JSON string
in the body of the request. */
   // JavaScript example using `fetch` to send JSON data to an Api
   /*
```javascript

const dataToSend = {
   name: "John",
   age: 30,
   city: "Exampleville"
};

fetch('https://api.example.com/data-endpoint', {
   method: 'Post',
   headers: {
     'Content-Type': 'application/JSON'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend)
})
.then(response => response.JSON())
.then(data => {
   console.log('Server response:', data);
});

```
*/
   /* In short, to consume JSON data, you must make Http requests to retrieve data and parse it
in your application. To produce JSON data, you must create a data structure, serialize it in JSON format
and send it via an Http request. These are the bases for working with JSON in applications that
They interact with web services and Apis. */

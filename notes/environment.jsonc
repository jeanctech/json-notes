    //* Environment - JSON
    /* The term "JSON environment" generally refers to the context or set of technologies and
tools surrounding the use of JSON in applications and software systems. This includes libraries,
programming languages, protocols and practices related to JSON. Next, it
They describe key aspects of the JSON environment.

/// 1. **Programming languages:**

JSON is used in a wide variety of programming languages,
including JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Ruby, Php, among others. Each language provides libraries and
functions to parse and generate data in JSON format.

/// 2. **JSON Libraries:**

Many programming languages have specific libraries to work with.
JSON. These libraries make it easy to manipulate and analyze JSON data. Examples include the
`JSON` library in Python, `JSON.Net` in C#, and `Jackson` in Java.

/// 3. **Rest API:**

JSON is a format commonly used in Rest Api (Representational State Transfer) for
represent resources and data. In a Rest Api environment, JSON is used to send and receive data between
clients and servers.

/// 4. **NoSql databases:**

Some NoSql databases, such as MongoDb, store data in Bson format,
which is a binary extension of JSON. This allows efficient storage of structured data.

/// 5. **Data exchange format:**

JSON is used as a data exchange format in distributed systems. It is common in applications
web, mobile applications, cloud services and microservices.

/// 6. **Configuration format:**

JSON is used for configuration of applications and services.
Configuration files are often stored in JSON format due to its simplicity and readability.

/// 7. **Testing and data validation:**

JSON validation tools and libraries allow you to verify whether JSON data meets a
specific scheme or structure. This is useful to ensure data integrity.

/// 8. **Documentation and specifications:**

Api documentation and specifications often include examples of JSON data to illustrate
how to interact with a service or an API.

/// 9. **Analysis and visualization tools:**

There are tools that make it easier to view and analyze JSON data, which can be useful
in debugging and development.

/// 10. **Security:**

In the JSON environment, it is important to consider safe practices, such as validation of
JSON data and preventing security attacks such as code injection.

In summary, the JSON environment encompasses a wide range of technologies and tools used to
work with JSON in applications and software systems. JSON plays a fundamental role in
data transfer and representation in most modern applications. */

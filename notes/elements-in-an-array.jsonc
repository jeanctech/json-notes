  //* Elements in an Array - JSON
  /* In JSON, elements within an array are represented as an ordered list of separate values
by commas and contents in square brackets `[ ]`. These elements can be of various types, such as strings,
numbers, JSON objects, JSON arrays, boolean values (`true` or `false`) and null values (`null`).
Next, I show you how the elements are defined within a JSON array. */

  /* In this example, we have a JSON array called `"names"` that contains three elements, all of them are
text strings. */
  // To include more complex elements, such as nested JSON objects or JSON arrays, you can do it as follows:
  // Following way.
  /* In this case, the JSON array `"people"` contains JSON objects nested as elements. each object
represents information about a person and contains key-value pairs, such as `"name"` and `"age"`.

You can also have arrays as elements inside an array, as shown below:


In this example, the JSON array `"arrays"` contains three arrays as elements. Each of the matrices
internal is a row of data. */
  /* Remember that JSON is a structured data format that follows a specific syntax. The elements in
an array are separated by commas and the array itself is enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. The objects
within the array must be contained in curly braces `{ }` if nested JSON objects are used. Each value in
the array must be valid according to JSON formatting rules. */

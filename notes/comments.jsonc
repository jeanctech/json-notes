    //* Comments - JSON
    /* JSON - JavaScript Object Notation is a data exchange format designed to be simple and
efficient. Unlike some other data formats, such as XML, JSON does not support comments. In JSON,
There is no standard way to include comments within the data. The JSON specification does not provide
a syntax for comments. */
    /* Since JSON does not support comments, if you need to add comments for documentation or clarification
in your data, it is advisable to do it outside of the JSON, in the associated documentation or in the code
that uses JSON data. For example, you can use comments in your application's source code to
explain the structure of your JSON data. */
    // Example of comments in code (JavaScript) that explains the structure of a JSON object.
    // JSON data representing customer information
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "Exampleville"
    /* Another option is to maintain a separate specification document or documentation that describes the
structure and meanings of the fields in your JSON data. */
    /* If you need to include metadata or additional information in your JSON data, you can do so using
additional properties within the JSON object, but keep in mind that this additional data will be
available for processing by the application and will not be considered comments. */
    /* In short, JSON itself does not support comments. If you want to document your JSON data, it is
recommended use comments in the code or external documentation to maintain clarity and understanding
of the data structure. */

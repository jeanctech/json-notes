    //* Uses - JSON
    /* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, easy-to-read data exchange format, which is
Commonly used in programming to represent structured data. Here are some of the
most common uses of JSON. */
    // 1. Communication between applications:
    /* JSON is widely used to exchange data between different applications and systems. This
may include communication between web servers and clients, web services, mobile applications
and more. */
    // 2. Data storage in databases:
    /* JSON is often used to store structured data in NoSql databases, such as MongoDb and
Firebase Realtime Database. JSON documents can represent database records and be
stored and retrieved easily. */
    // 3. Configuration and preferences files:
    /* JSON is used in applications to store user settings, preferences and options.
This allows users to customize the application according to their needs. */
    // 4. Data exchange with Apis:
    /* Many web APIs return data in JSON format. Developers can make requests to a
Api and receive the data in JSON for processing and display in applications. */
    // 5. Object serialization:
    /* JSON is used to convert objects into a string representation that can be sent or stored,
and can then be deserialized to recreate the original object. This is especially common in languages
programming such as JavaScript and Python. */
    // 6. Configuration data storage:
    /* JSON is a popular format for storing configuration data, such as application options,
in configuration files. This makes customization and configuration management easier. */
    // 7. Data structuring in web applications:
    /* JSON is used on the client side to structure and manage data in web applications.
It is particularly useful in single page applications (SPAs) that interact with the server through
of Ajax requests. */
    // 8. Share data on social networks:
    /* Some social networks allow you to share structured data in the form of JSON. This may include
metadata of a web page, such as title, description, and a preview image, used when
share links. */
    // 9. Data representation in mobile applications:
    /* Mobile apps often use JSON to stream data from the server and display it
in the application's user interface. This includes downloading content, such as news,
images and updates. */
    // 10. Event logging and data tracking:
    /* JSON is used to log events and data in applications and systems. This is useful for
data analysis and tracking user activity in an application. */
    /* In summary, JSON is a versatile and widely used tool in programming to
represent structured data in a readable and efficient way, and is used in a variety of
applications in web development, mobile applications and more. */

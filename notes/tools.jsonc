    //* Tools - JSON
    /* There are many tools and resources available to work with JSON data on various platforms
and programming languages. Here I mention some of the most common and useful tools to work with.
with JSON. */
    // 1. **Text Editors and Ides (Integrated Development Environments):**
    /* - Visual Studio Code: A highly customizable code editor with built-in support for JSON.
    It offers syntax highlighting, automatic formatting, and JSON-related extensions. */
    /* - Sublime Text: A text editor with support for JSON and many extensions that make work easier
    with JSON data. */
    /* - Atom: Another extensible code editor with support for JSON and numerous related extensions. */
    // 2. **Online tools:**
    /* - JSON Lint: An online validator that allows you to check the syntax of your JSON data and
    format them correctly. */
    /* - JSON Viewer: An online tool that allows you to view JSON data in a more readable way
    and structured. */
    /* - JSON to Csv Converter: Converts JSON data to Csv files for easier analysis. */
    // 3. **Libraries and Modules in Programming Languages:**
    /* - In almost all programming languages, there are libraries or modules that allow you to analyze,
    generate and manipulate JSON data. For example, in JavaScript, you can use the `JSON` object to parse
    and stringifyJSON. In Python, you can use the `JSON` library to work with JSON. */
    // 4. **Web Development Tools:**
    /* - Postman: A popular API testing tool that supports requests and responses in
    JSON. */
    /* - Swagger: A framework and tool for designing, generating documentation and testing Apis,
    which often uses JSON to describe Apis. */
    // 5. **NoSql Databases:**
    /* - Many NoSql databases, such as MongoDb and CouchDb, store data in JSON or Bson format
    (a JSON extension). These databases are ideal for storing structured JSON data. */
    // 6. **Commands on the Command Line:**
    /* - On Unix and Linux systems, you can use command line tools like `jq` to process
    and manipulate JSON data from the terminal. */
    // 7. **Web Frameworks:**
    /* - In web development, many frameworks and libraries, such as Angular, React, and Vue.js, work with
    data JSON to exchange information between the client and the server. */
    // 8. **Data Visualization Tools:**
    /* - D3.js: A JavaScript library used to display data on the web and can
    work with data in JSON format. */
    /* - Tableau: A data visualization tool that can import data in JSON format and create
    interactive visualizations. */
    /* These are just some of the tools you can use to work with JSON in different
contexts. The choice of tool will depend on your specific needs and the technology with which you are
using. that you are working. */

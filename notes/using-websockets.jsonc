    //* Using Websockets - JSON
    /* - JavaScript Object Notation and WebSockets are two technologies that are often used together to
enable real-time two-way communication between web applications. WebSockets provide
a persistent, low-latency connection between the client and the server, while JSON is used to
structure and transmit data over this connection. Some of the uses are explained below.
JSON commons in combination with WebSockets. */
    // 1. **Real Time Message Exchange:**
    /* WebSockets allow the transmission of messages in real time between the client and the server. JSON
used to structure these messages so that they can contain structured information.
For example, in a real-time chat application, messages sent via WebSockets
They can be in JSON format to include the message content, sender, timestamp, etc. */
    // 2. **Real Time Notifications:**
    /* Web applications often use WebSockets and JSON to send real-time notifications to users.
users. This could include notifications of new messages, content updates, email alerts.
events, etc. JSON is used to structure information related to notifications. */
    // 3. **Multiplayer Games:**
    /* In multiplayer online games, JSON is used to transmit game data, such as the position of
players, game events, results and other game-related data. WebSockets guarantee a
real-time communication, and JSON is used to define the communication protocol and structure the
game data. */
    // 4. **Real Time Data Update:**
    /* Business and data tracking applications can use WebSockets to update the
real time data. JSON is used to transmit updated data, such as changes in the status of
inventory, sensor updates, changes in the financial market, etc. */
    // 5. **Real Time Collaboration:**
    /* Collaboration applications, such as online office suites and collaborative whiteboards,
They use WebSockets to allow users to collaborate in real time on documents and projects. JSON
It is used to transmit changes made by users and synchronize information. */
    // 6. **Monitoring and Control of IoT Devices:**
    /* In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), WebSockets are used to monitor and control
devices in real time. JSON is used to transmit sensor data, control commands and other
relevant information.

/// 7. **Instant Messaging Systems:**

/* In instant messaging applications, WebSockets and JSON are used to enable communication
in real time between users. JSON structures chat messages, including text, sender,
recipient, timestamps, etc. */
    // 8. **Real-Time Data Api:**
    /* Real-time data Apis, such as those that provide financial, weather and
tracking, use WebSockets and JSON to provide updated data in real time to applications and
websites. */
    /* By combining WebSockets and JSON, web applications can achieve efficient and timely communication
real, which is essential in a variety of use cases, from messaging to data tracking
and device control. JSON provides a readable and easy-to-parse data structure, which
makes it a popular choice for transmitting structured information in applications that use
WebSockets. */

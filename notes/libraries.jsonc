    //* Libraries - JSON
    /* There are many libraries and modules available in various programming languages that allow you
work with JSON more efficiently and effectively. These libraries provide functions for
parse (parse) JSON data, generate JSON data, manipulate JSON objects, and perform other operations
related to JSON. Next, I will mention some of the most common libraries to work with
with JSON in different languages. */
    // 1. **JavaScript**:
    /* - `JSON.parse()`: JavaScript has native support for working with JSON. You can use `JSON.parse()`
   to parse a JSON string into a JavaScript object. */
    /* - `JSON.stringify()`: This function is used to convert a JavaScript object to a string
    JSON. */
    // 2. **Python**:
    /* - `JSON` (standard module): Python includes a standard `JSON` module that allows you to load (parse)
     and save (serialize) JSON data. You can use `JSON.loads()` to load JSON data and `JSON.dumps()`
     to serialize data to JSON. */
    /* - `simpleJSON`: An alternative to `JSON` that is faster in certain cases and provides
    additional characteristics. */
    // 3. **Java**:
    /* - `Jackson`: Jackson is one of the most popular JSON libraries for Java. Provides analysis
    and efficient JSON generation and is widely used in Java projects. */
    /* - `Gson`: Another very popular Java library for working with JSON. It is especially useful for
    convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa. */
    // 4. **C# (C Sharp)**:
    /* - `Newtonsoft.JSON` (JSON.Net): JSON.Net is a widely used library in the ecosystem of
    .Net development. Provides JSON parsing and generation, plus advanced features for
    work with JSON flexibly. */
    // 5. **Ruby**:
    /* - `JSON` (standard module): Ruby includes a standard JSON module that allows you to parse and generate
    JSON. You can use `JSON.parse()` to parse JSON and `JSON.generate()` to generate JSON. */
    // 6. **Php**:
    /* - `JSON_encode()` and `JSON_decode()`: Php provides native functions to work with JSON.
     `JSON_encode()` is used to convert PHP data structures to JSON, and `JSON_decode()` is used to
     parse JSON data into Php objects or arrays. */
    /* These are just some of the libraries and functions available in various programming languages
to work with JSON. Depending on your project and programming language, you can choose the library
that best suits your needs and preferences. */

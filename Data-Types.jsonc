//? Data Types - Json

/* Json - JavaScript Object Notation supports several basic data types for representing information
structured. Here is a description of the data types supported by Json. */

//* 1. **Numbers:**

// Json supports integer and floating point numbers. The numbers can be in standard decimal notation
// (for example, `42` or `3.14`) and can include a positive or negative sign.

//? Data Types - Json

      // Examples of numbers in Json:
      "integer_number" : 42,
      "decimal_number" : -3.14,
      // Examples of text strings in Json:
      "string_one": "Hello, world",
      "String_two" : "double quotes",
      // Examples of booleans in Json
      "boolean_one": true,
      "boolean_two" : false,
      // Example of `null` in Json
      "varlor_null" : null

//* 2. **Text Strings:**

/* Text strings in Json must always be enclosed in double quotes (`"`). Strings can contain
Unicode and escaped characters, such as escape sequences for double quotes or control characters. */

//* 3. **Booleans:**

/* Json supports two boolean values: `true` and `false`. These represent the states of truth and falsehood,
respectively. */

//* 4. **null:**

/* The special value `null` in Json represents the absence of a value or the lack of a defined value. */

//* 5. **Objects:**

/* Json objects are defined within curly braces `{}` and contain key-value pairs. Keys must be strings
text enclosed in double quotes, and the values can be any Json data type, including other
objects or arrangements. */

//* 6. **Arrangements:**

/* Json arrays are defined within `[]` square brackets and contain an ordered list of values. The values
can be any Json data type, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and
`null`.

/* These basic Json data types allow you to represent a wide variety of structured information
in a simple and human-readable way. Combining JSON objects and arrays, along with these types
data, provides a versatile way to represent and transmit data in web applications, services
NoSql web and databases. */

//? Conclusions - Json

/* In short, Json - JavaScript Object Notation is a widely used data exchange format
and extremely valuable in the development of software applications and systems. Next, it
present some key takeaways about Json. */

//* 1. **Simplicity and readability:**

/* Json is a simple and easy to understand format. Its structure based on key-value pairs and the capacity
Nesting objects and arrays make it ideal for representing structured data. */

//* 2. **Wide adoption:**

/* Json is widely used in web applications, Rest APIs, NoSql databases, communications between
systems and more. It is a common way of exchanging data between different software components and
services on the Internet. */

//* 3. **Multi-platform support:**

/* Json can be used in a variety of programming languages, and most languages
provide libraries to parse and generate Json, making it easy to deploy on systems
heterogeneous. */

//* 4. **Data transfer efficiency:**

/* Json is efficient in transferring data due to its
light format. This makes it a solid choice for data communication over the network. */

//* 5. **Flexible structure:**

/* Json allows nesting of objects and arrays, making it easier to represent complex data
and structured hierarchically. */

//* 6. **Easy human readability:**

/* Json data is human-readable, making it easy to debug and inspect data without
need for special tools. */

//* 7. **No comments allowed:**

/* Although there is no comment syntax, it is possible to document the structure and purpose of comments.
Json data in the code documentation or in external documents. */

//* 8. **Security:**

/* As with any data exchange, it is important to validate and sanitize Json data to
prevent security attacks, such as code injection. */

/* In short, Json has become a de facto standard for representing structured data
in modern applications and information systems. Its simplicity, efficiency and wide adoption make it
be a solid choice for data communication in software development. */

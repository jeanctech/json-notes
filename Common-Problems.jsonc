//? Common Problems - Json

/* Despite the simplicity and wide adoption of Json (JavaScript Object Notation), there are some
common problems that developers may face when working with JSON. Here is a list of
common problems and how to address them. */

//* 1. **Incorrect Syntax:**

/* One of the most common problems is incorrect syntax in a Json document. This may be due to
missing or extra commas, curly braces that do not close correctly, unquoted text strings, or
typographical errors. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Use Json validation tools, such as Json Lint, to verify the syntax of your documents
Json. Modern Ides also typically offer syntax highlighting and automatic error correction. */

//* 2. **Incorrect Coding:**

/* Make sure the Json document is encoded correctly. If encoding is used
incorrect, it can cause problems when interpreting the Json. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Use UTF-8 encoding for your Json documents, as it is widely supported and recommended. */

//* 3. **Misuse of Quotes:**

/* Keys and text strings in Json must be enclosed in double quotes. Use single quotes u
forgetting quotes can cause problems. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Make sure all keys and strings are enclosed in double quotes. */

//* 4. **Duplicate Keys:**

/* Json does not allow duplicate keys in the same object. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Make sure all keys in a Json object are unique. */

//* 5. **Order of Elements:**

/* Json does not guarantee a specific order of key-value pairs in an object. Depending on the context, the
order of the elements may not be significant. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Don't trust the order of elements within a Json object. If order is important, consider
use a Json array instead. */

//* 6. **Incorrect Parsification:**

/* When parsing (parsing) JSON in your code, it is important to handle parsification errors. A bad Json
formed can cause exceptions in your application. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Use Json parsing functions provided by your programming language and handle parsing errors
parsification correctly. */

//* 7. **Excessive Data Size:**

/* In some circumstances, excessive use of Json data may increase bandwidth consumption and
affect performance. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Consider Json data compression if data transfer efficiency is critical. */

//* 8. **Excessive Nesting:**

/* Excessive nesting of objects and arrays in Json can make it difficult to read and maintain.
code. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Keep the structure of your Json as simple and clear as possible. Avoid nesting objects deeply and
arrangements if not necessary. */

//* 9. **Security:**

/* Security is important when receiving and parsing Json data from external sources, as the content
Malicious can cause security problems, such as injection attacks. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Validates and sanitizes Json data before processing. Use safe libraries to parse Json and
prevents the execution of malicious code. */

//* 10. **Excessive File Size:**

/* Json is not the ideal choice for storing large data sets due to its human-readable text.
humans. In such cases, it is preferable to use more efficient formats such as Bson or binary protocols. */

//? **Solution:**

/* Evaluates whether Json is the best option for storing large amounts of data. In some cases, it may be
necessary to use a more efficient data format. */

/* In general, proper use of Json and adherence to syntax and best practices will help avoid
most common problems associated with this data format. */

//? Data Communications - Json

/* Json - JavaScript Object Notation is a data exchange format widely used in
data communications in web applications and distributed systems. Allows efficient transfer of
structured information between heterogeneous systems. Here are some common ways Json is
used in data communications. */

//* 1. **Api Rest (Representational State Transfer):**

/* In Rest APIs, Json is a format of choice to represent resources and their data. The requests
Http generally use Json to send data in the request body (Post, Put, Path), and the
API responses are often sent as Json. This allows efficient communication between the client
and the server. */

//* 2. **WebSocket:**

/* In real-time applications that use WebSocket for two-way communication, Json is used
to pack and unpack data sent between the client and the server. This is especially common
in real-time chat applications, online games and other collaborative applications. */

//* 3. **XmlHttpRequest (Xhr) and Fetch Api:**

/* When making Ajax requests from a web browser, Json is one of the most common formats for
send and receive data. Responses are often parsed and displayed dynamically in the user interface.
user. */

//* 4. **Real-time data transfer:**

/* In applications that require continuous transfer of data in real time, such as telemetry,
IoT (Internet of Things) and live tracking systems, Json is used to structure and
transmit data between devices and servers. */

//* 5. **Integration of cloud services:**

/* When integrating third-party services or communicating with cloud services APIs, it is common for
These services return or expect data in Json format. This facilitates the integration and exchange of
information between applications. */

//* 6. **NoSql databases:**

/* Some NoSql databases, such as MongoDb, store data in Bson format (a binary extension of Json).
This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data in a Json-like format. */

//* 7. **Communication between microservices:**

/* In microservices-based architectures, Json is used to transmit data between different
components or services. Each service can produce or consume data in Json format, which facilitates communication between them. */

//* 8. **Integration of legacy systems:**

/* Json is often used as an intermediate format in integrating legacy systems with systems
modern. Legacy systems may produce or consume data in a less structured format, and Json
It is used as a common format for exchanging data. */

/* In all these cases, Json is chosen for its simplicity, readability and ease of parsing both for
part of humans as well as machines. Additionally, most programming languages offer support for
parse and generate Json, which makes it easy to implement in different systems. */
